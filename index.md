## RetroTicker

RetroTicker is a simple scrolling text ticker to display custom messages with animations.  So what's "retro" about it?  Similar to traditional-style tickers that use a grid of lightbulbs to display their messages (think NYSE), RetroTicker is comprised of a 2D grid of Panels that display messages by changing the background colors for each Panel.  By implementing the ticker in this way, I was able to create my own font and custom animations.
